## Getting Started

Fork this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/IntroToStats) and
clone to your computer. 

Follow along with [this article](https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/data-science-statistics-using-python/), in the notebook you just opened. We suggest that instead of copy and pasting the code, you type it out.  This will help you become more familiar with the syntax and better understand it.

## Submitting Your Work

When finished make sure to push your changes up to GitHub. Copy the link to your GitHub
repository and paste it into the submission box in Canvas for **Exercises: Data Modeling Part 1**
and click *Submit*.
