Before we dive into learning Data Analysis, we want to share with you more about our educational philosophy here at LaunchCode and how we structure our courses. We appreciate that many adults thrive in learning environments that are based on transparency and trust.

You will hear us say many times that our ultimate goal is to empower you to learn how to learn. The first step in this process is for us to be clear with you on how we teach. If something is not effective for you, we encourage you to investigate why it is not effective and seek the assistance of your course staff. Perhaps the alternate phrasing about a key term in an article online will help you understand what that concept is about. Maybe a video will help drive home the importance of a certain concept. Everyone learns differently and this book serves as a starting point.

Ultimately, we aim to teach the fundamental concepts and technologies we have found you will need to launch a career in data analytics. As you progress in your career, you will have to learn new concepts and technologies to succeed. We want to set you up for success, by not only teaching you the core fundamentals, but also by inspiring you to continue learning and exploring this field after you have left our classroom.
