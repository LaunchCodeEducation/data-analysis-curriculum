We have already encountered cleaning data, so we should revisit the topic quicky.

As we discussed in the previous chapter on cleaning data, we need to clean our data to ensure that our analysis is accurate. If we want to perform a regression analysis later on, the analysis will use all the existing data points. By cleaning our data first, we can ensure that the data points being used in the analysis are what we need. 

As we previously covered, there are four types of dirty data:

1. missing data
1. irregular data
1. unnecessary data
1. inconsistent data

Pandas has different ways of handling these types. Because pandas is so powerful, we can easily search for dirty data and handle it. Let's examine each dirty data type and how we can clean it in pandas.
