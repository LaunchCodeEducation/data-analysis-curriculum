## Getting Started

For this week's studio you will be working with a partner.  

Each of you should work in your notebook that can be found within this repository [Cleaning Data with Pandas Exercises and Studio](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/cleaning-data-pandas-exercises-studio/tree/main).

You will also notice that we have already added a CSV for you. This CSV is a subset of a larger dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usda/a-year-of-pumpkin-prices) from the USDA. You only need this one CSV to do the studio.

## In Your Notebook

The notebook poses questions for partners to discuss and answer about data cleaning.

Code has been provided so that discussion can be the primary focus of the studio.

Spaces for notes and answers to questions provided in the notebook.

## Submitting Your Work

When finished make sure to push your changes up to GitHub. 

Copy the link to your GitHub repository and paste it into the submission box in Canvas for **Studio: Cleaning Data** and click *Submit*.
