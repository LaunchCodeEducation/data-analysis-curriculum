## Business Issue and Understanding

You are working for the Bureau of Labor Statistics with the United States government and have been approached by your boss with an important meeting request. You have been asked by your supervisor to meet with Dolly Parton, whose nonprofit is looking to shed light on the state of employment in the United States. As part of the 9 to 5 project, their research is focused on production and nonsupervisory employees and how those employees fare compared to all employees in the United States. While the data the BLS collects from the CES is publicly available, Dolly Parton and her colleagues need your assistance navigating the thousands of rows in each table in `LaborStatisticsDB`.

## More on the Dataset

For this assignment, you will be using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Current Employment Survey (CES) results which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bls/employment) and are already added to `LaborStatisticsDB` for you.

Here are some things you need to know about this dataset:

1. The industry table contains an NAICS code. This is different from the industry code. NAICS stands for North American Industry Classification System.
1. Series ID is composed of multiple different codes. CES stands for Current Employment Survey, the name of the survey which collected the data. The industry code as specified by the BLS and the data type code as specified in the datatype table.
