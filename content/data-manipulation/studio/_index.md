## Getting Started

This week's studio will be continuing our work with the USDA Pumpkin Prices dataset.

Fork and clone the following repository (if you have not already done so from completing the exercises) to begin work on the exercises: [data-manipulation-exercises-studio](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/data-manipulation-exercises-studio)

## In Your Notebook

As always confer with a partner if you want to talk something through!

You are more than welcome to pull up your notebook from the last lesson to help you speed through cleaning the data and get straight to manipulating it.

## Submitting Your Work

When finished make sure to push your changes up to GitHub.

Copy the link to your GitHub repository and paste it into the submission box in Canvas for **Studio: Data Manipulation** and click *Submit*.
