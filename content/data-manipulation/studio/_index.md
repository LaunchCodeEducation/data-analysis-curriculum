## Getting Started

For the studio, we will be continuing to work with pumpkins in small groups.

## In Your Notebooks

As always confer with a partner if you want to talk something through!

You are more than welcome to also pull up your notebook from the last lesson to help you speed through cleaning the data and get straight to manipulating it.

## Submitting Your Work

When finished make sure to push your changes up to GitHub.

Copy the link to your GitHub repository and paste it into the submission box in Canvas for **Studio: Data Manipulation** and click *Submit*.
