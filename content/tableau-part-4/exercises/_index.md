This chapter is focused on working with dates and creating beautiful and effective visualizations and stories in Tableau. So when it comes to practicing these functions, we want you to create a bullet journal in Tableau.

A bullet journal is a system designed by Ryder Carroll that has grown in popularity over the past decade with over 10 million posts on Instagram under #bulletjournal and countless Youtubers sharing their latest bullet journal spreads. Many attribute the popularity of the system to its flexibility. Ultimately, us as the journalers can decide to put in our journals whatever we need. We can create spreads to track our progress on financial goals, reading goals, or any other goals that matter to us. We can also be as artistic as we want to be with our bullet journals. 

While you will likely find many posts about the virtues of bullet journals as a creative endeavour, every bullet journal contains a lot of data and a lot of it is time-based, which is why we are asking you to create one in Tableau.

## Getting Started

Before you open up Tableau, take some time to brainstorm. You need to create at least three visualizations, representing three spreads in your Tableau bullet journal. If you are already a bullet journal advocate, do you want to recreate three spreads you have already made? Are you struggling to think of what data you could track with Tableau? People have created so many wonderful different spreads in bullet journals, so here are just a few ideas to get you started.

1. water intake
1. Exercise data, such as: steps and workout trackers
1. hours of sleep
1. screentime
1. mood tracker
1. mealtimes/macros intake
1. goodreads
1. medicine tracker

In addition, you can also find even more ideas on Pinterest and Instagram. Once you have your three spreads planned, you need the data behind the spreads. If you do not want to share your own data, try to make a bullet journal for a fictional character. Your data can be in whatever form you find helpful whether it starts with a spreadsheet or Pandas DataFrame. If you pull any data from Kaggle to add to your bullet journal, make sure to share the source.

## Putting together Your Vizzes

As you work on the exercises, remind yourself of what we said in the reading. In the field of data, no one has found a correlation betweeen artistic and beautiful and effective. In the world of bullet journals, a minimal spread can be just as effective to a user as one decked out with illustrations.

## Submitting Your Work

Once your work is complete, publish your story and submit the link on Canvas for the exercises.
