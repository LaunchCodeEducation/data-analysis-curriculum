You won't oftentimes find in your career that one visualization says all that you need it to. You may have to create a series of visualizations to show off your analysis. Connecting a group of visualizations for the purpose of conveying key findings of your analysis is called a **story**. A story can be composed of multiple dashboards but each individual sheet in a story is called a **story point**.

## How to Create a Story

In the upper left-hand corner, you have three buttons for creating a new worksheet, a new dashboard, and a new story. You can start there with creating your first story. You can edit how the viz appears in your stories and add more and more to your stories. As you add to your story, each story point will appear at the top.

## Story Best Practices

The same principles that help you make an effective viz will help you make a good story.

You also want to make sure that you format your story to fit the screen that the story will be shown on.

Here are some examples of different Tableau stories worth exploring. As you review each one, make note of what you like about each one.
