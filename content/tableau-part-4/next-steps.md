That brings an end to our work on Tableau! Before you dive into mathematical modeling, if you feel that you need some additional resources on Tableau, here are a few of our favorites on the topics covered in this chapter.

1. [Best Practices for Effective Dashboards](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_best_practices.htm)
1. [Do No Harm Guide (7:08 min video)](https://www.tableau.com/foundation/data-equity/do-no-harm)

In addition, we recognize that many of these topics can feel somewhat nebulous so if you want some additional practice, we recommend you check out this [great resume activity](https://www.tableau.com/blog/how-create-interactive-resume-tableau) from Tableau!
