That brings an end to our work on Tableau! 

If you feel that you need some additional resources on Tableau, here are a few of our favorites on the topics covered in this chapter.

1. [Best Practices for Effective Dashboards](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_best_practices.htm)
1. [Do No Harm Guide (7:08 min video)](https://www.tableau.com/foundation/data-equity/do-no-harm)

2. [The "Do No Harm Guide" link above appears to be broken. I found this video on Vimeo, which has the same title and is the same link: https://vimeo.com/778356303 I also found this article, which seems to be a transcript of the video in the tableau docs, which I imagine may be more stable: https://www.tableau.com/foundation/data-equity/do-no-harm/video-transcript It also links to the video and is probably the better choice. In any case, we need to update the text and link above with whichever you like best.]: # 

In addition, we recognize that many of these topics can feel somewhat nebulous. If you want some additional practice, we recommend you check out this [great resume activity](https://www.tableau.com/blog/how-create-interactive-resume-tableau) from Tableau!
