- find patterns and connections, answer hypotheses and find solutions from data
- Know how to uncover a data structure, aka get to know the dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is a vital step for us to begin our work with. EDA is a process where we attempt to find patterns and connections, locate outliers, and begin to uncover the structure of our dataset. We cannot do this process with any assumptions or end goals. We just want to understand what we have access to. The main reason we do EDA is so that we can determine the best path forward.  After EDA, you may go back and pull more numbers because you realized that you do not have the information you need or you may decide that you will use a different regression model than the one you previously thought would work for the data.

The EDA process should do the following for you:

1. Help you form hypotheses about what is the underlying reason for some data.
1. Challenge previous assumptions you may have made when discussing the business issue.
1. Guide you on what tools and techniques you should use when working with that dataset. 

The technical steps we will take to begin this process are:

1. Descriptive statistics on the dataset
1. Create visualizations
1. Take steps to locate outliers

Descriptive statistics include measures of variance such as standard deviation and mean, median, and mode. We run descriptive statistics on the dataset to begin the process of locating outliers and get a general sense of what we are working with.

Creating visualizations help us further understand what we are seeing in the descriptive statistics. Based on whether the EDA is a multivariate or univariate analysis, we may choose different styles of visualizaations to figure out what is going on. While these visualizations may not be part of the final presentation, creating visualizations are integral to beginning the data analysis project.

While you are beginning to understand the shape of the dataset you are working on, you may come to realize that something is off. An anomaly or outlier in your dataset may be distorting the shape and thus interfering with your ability to come to an understanding and decide on your next steps. As you will learn in the next chapter, data cleaning goes hand in hand with EDA and helps you handle outliers and other things that may need to be removed from the dataset. While doing EDA, you will find it immensely helpful to make note of these discoveries so that you can more efficiently clean the dataset.
