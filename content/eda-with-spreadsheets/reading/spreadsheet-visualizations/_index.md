Now that we have done some statistics, we need to start creating some visualizations. These visualizations are not meant to be perfect or presented to business leaders, these are for us to further uncover the shape of the data set and outline the approach we want to take with our statistical models.

However, while Google Sheets has numerous options for visualizations, we need to decide which chart to start with. We can begin to focus our search by determining whether we are not we focusing on one variable or multiple. 

We can start wherever we like, whether with scatter plots, bar graphs, and line charts. We will learn more about the process of choosing visualizations and how to make them more effective later on in this course when we get closer to Tableau. For now, we want to use visualizations as a tool to help us learn more about our dataset.

To start the process of making some visualizations, first decide what series you want to visualize and click on *Insert Chart*.

## Line Graph

A line graph might be a good place to start. The nice thing about EDA is that if this chart format doesn't help you, you can always select a different chart type.

## Bar or Column Chart

A bar chart is a chart where the columns lie horizontally measuring down the x-axis. A column chart is a chart where the columns lie vertically along the y axis.

## Scatterplot

A scatterplot is a collection of points where x and y are two series. A scatterplot only works if you have two variables you want to analyze.
