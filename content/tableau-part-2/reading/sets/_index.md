A **set** lies between a context filter and a dimension filter. Sets allow us to grab a specific group of data for our analysis and are a form of Tableau group.
A fiscal year is a subset!!
Why woud we use one?

If we are analyzing earrings sales for the past five years, we could use a set for each of the five years. While it is helpful for us to have an overarching look at the whole five years, having a set for 2021, for example, allows us to drill down and provide additional analysis and calculations.
