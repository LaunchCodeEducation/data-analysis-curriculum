The final project is an opportunity to showcase your analysis skills from EDA to 
visualization and produce a project for your professional portfolio. The project 
is broken into five checkpoints and a final presentation.

<!-- TODO: Update these links as you work -->

1. [Selecting your business issue and dataset]({{% relref "./checkpoint-1" %}})
1. [EDA]()
1. [Cleaning data]({{% relref "./checkpoint-3" %}})
1. [Manipulate, interpret, and visualize data]({{% relref "./checkpoint-4" %}})
