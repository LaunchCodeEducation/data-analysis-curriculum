For this assignment, we will be working with call center data. You can start 
working on the assignment after the first lesson on Exploratory Data Analysis. 
Make sure to read the whole assignment before starting anything! As you code 
along in the Jupyter notebook, you are asked to make note of the results of 
your analysis. Do so by clicking on the results box and adding your notes 
beside each question.

## Business Issue and Understanding

You are working for a company that has two call centers: the North Call 
Center and the South Call Center. The company is looking to possibly hire five 
additional reps to enhance customer experience. Your task is to explore how 
efficient the current reps are in each branch to determine which branch would 
benefit from additional assistance.

### How the Call Center Works

Call center representatives are assigned queues. When calls are assigned to a 
queue, the call is assigned to the next person in line in the queue. After a call 
is assigned to a representative, the amount of time between assignment and the 
call starting is divided into busy minutes and not ready minutes. If the call is 
incoming and a customer is waiting on the phone for a rep, the time is split into 
three categories: busy minutes, not ready minutes, and incoming call wait time. 
Once the rep has the customer on the phone, there might be during call wait time, 
where the call is put on hold while the rep gets an answer for the customer.
