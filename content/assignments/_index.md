## What is a Graded Assignment?
Graded Assignments will count towards your final grade in the course. Each assignment is graded pass-fail. While [Assignment 0]({{% relref "./assignment0/_index.md" %}}) is more of a tutorial to get you used to submitting Google Sheets for grading, you need a passing grade on each assignment to complete the course. Each assignment builds on concepts introduced over multiple lessons, so we would like you to begin reviewing the assignment and working on the different tasks as soon as the assignment becomes available in Canvas.
