## What is a Graded Assignment?
Graded Assignments will count towards your final grade in the course. Each assignment is graded pass-fail. While [Assignment 0]({{% relref "./assignment0/_index.md" %}}) is more of a tutorial to get you used to Google Sheets, you have to get a passing grade on each assignment in order for you to complete the course. Each assignment builds on concepts introduced over multiple lessons, so we encourage you to begin reviewing the assignment and working on the different tasks as soon as the assignment becomes available in Canvas.
