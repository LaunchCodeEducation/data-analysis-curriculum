# LaunchCode

You just created a brand new curriculum! Feel free to create new chapters or segments however you normally would. You can also find useful links below that may help inspire.

You pulled in three LaunchCode created github submodules:
- `layouts`: provides slides shortcode and overwrites menu footer
- `static`: provides launchcode logo, favicon, and theme variants
- `archetypes`: provides segment archetype for new chapters

Example usage of segment:
```bash
hugo new --kind chapter <name>/_index.md
```

Upon running the above command it will create a new chapter named `chapter-name`
