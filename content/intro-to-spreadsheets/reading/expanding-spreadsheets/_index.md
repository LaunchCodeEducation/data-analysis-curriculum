## Adding Rows and Columns to a Spreadsheet

As you work more on spreadsheets, you may find that you want to add a row or column in the middle of the spreadsheet. Maybe you realized that another column was necessary or you were importing data and a row was lost in the process. 

Let's revisit our Car Info workbook. While we already have some great data stored about the two cars, we need some more information. 

1. We want to insert a column between "Model" and "Car Mileage". Right-click on the D for the "Model" column and select *Insert 1 column right*. Alternatively, you can right-click on the E for the "Car Mileage" column and select *Insert 1 column left*.
1. You now have an empty column that is column E and "Car Mileage" is now column F. Type "Current Value" in E1.
1. Add the current value for both the cars you created on the previous page.

You can do the same for rows by right-clicking on the row number and inserting a new row above or below the one you selected.

## Adding Another Spreadsheet to an Existing Workbook

Now we want to add some additional information about the two cars. We want to add a maintenance log for each car so we can track how much we spent on the car in one year. This information would not make sense on the current spreadsheet so we are going to add a second one to our Car Info workbook.

At the bottom of the page, you will see a tab that says "Sheet1" next to a plus sign and a hamburger menu (three horizontal lines stacked on top of each other). Let's rename "Sheet1" by right-clicking and selecting *Rename*. Give it the new name, "Overview" and hit *enter* or *return*.

We are now ready to add a maintenance log for one of our cars. For example, we are going to add one for a car nicknamed Bob.

1. Hit the plus sign in the bottom left-hand corner. We have a new sheet called "Sheet2"
1. Rename the new sheet by right-clicking. For this exercise, we will rename ours to "Bob Maintenance".
1. Add the following to the first row in this order: "Task", "Date", "Cost".
1. Add one maintenance item to the spreadsheet. For example, we might add "Brake repair", 12/23/23, and 1000.

From here, we can continually add more data and spreadsheets to our workbook as the need arises.
