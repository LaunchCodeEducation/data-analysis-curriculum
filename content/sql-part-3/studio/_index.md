## Getting Started

For this week's studio, open up the `SQL-Part-3-Studio.ipynb` notebook in `data-analysis-projects/sql-part-3/studio` using Azure Data Studio.  

## In Your Notebook

The focus of this studio is to get more familiar with `JOIN` statements and to practice using them.
 
1. Break into small groups and work together to answer the questions.  
1. Each member of the group should be coding along in their own notebooks.  
1. In Part 2 of the studio, each person will pick their own month and create two events or promotions, creating queries to support their choices in their own notebook.
1. Each member of the group should have different questions and queries.
 
## Present to the Class

When the whole class comes back together, each person will present one of the events they created and the query used to solve it.
