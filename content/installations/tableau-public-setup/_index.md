## Creating a Tableau Public Account:

We will be working with [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover).

1. [Download the app](https://www.tableau.com/products/public/download).
1. [Create a Tableau Public account](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover?authMode=signUp).

We will also be referencing documentation provided by [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) throughout the readings.  

1. You can optionally make a separate account [here](https://id.tableau.com/register?clientId=d22771tvaQXmFdNduz4sh5pvlWu0HDbF) as well. This will allow you to access additional materials, like videos.
1. For additional video resources check out the videos [here](https://www.tableau.com/learn/training/20211).

## Additional Optional Resources:

The videos and tasks below are optional and not required, but are meant to serve as an additional resource for learning how to use and navigate a Tableau workspace.

{{% notice blue Note "rocket" %}}
As you watch the videos you may notice a discrepancy between your interface and one in the video.  
You are still able to code along with each video, you might have to look in a different location than 
shown in the video. 

You will need to save and publish your final charts in videos 1 and 6.  In order to complete the final 
worksheet in video 6, you will need to work through videos 4-6 in the same Tableau Public Visualization.
