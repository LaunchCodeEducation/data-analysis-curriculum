## Getting Started

In Visual Studio Code, open the `SQL-Part-5-Exercises.ipynb` file that is located within the `data-analysis-projects` repository you forked and cloned in an earlier lesson.


For the exercises and studio in this chapter, you need to connect to the `JunkDB` named after your class. This database serves as a playground for you to experiment with what you learned in this chapter. 

With your new connection configured, click on the junk database in the Object Explorer. Instead of clicking on *Tables*, click on the folder called *Security* and then *Schemas*. You should see a schema with your name on it. When practicing these queries, you will only be able to use your schema.

The example below shows how you can use the same process of finding the schema named after you to find the `HumanResources` schema in the `AdventureWorks2019` Database.
