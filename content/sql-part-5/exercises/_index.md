## Getting Started

Open up the `SQL-Part-5-Exercises.ipynb` notebook in `data-analysis-projects/sql-part-5/exercises`.

For the exercises and studio in this chapter, you need to connect to the `JunkDB` named after your class. This database serves as a playground for you to experiment with what you learned in this chapter. 

With your new connection configured, click on the junk database in the Object Explorer. Instead of clicking on *Tables*, click on the folder called *Security* and then *Schemas*. You should see a schema with your name on it. When practicing these queries, you will only be able to use your schema.

The example below is from the `AdventureWorks2019` Database.
