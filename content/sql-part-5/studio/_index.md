## Getting Started

For this week's studio, open up the `SQL-Part-5-Studio.ipynb` notebook in `data-analysis-projects/sql-part-5/studio`. You will need some starter data as you work which is all in the `data` directory within the `studio` directory.

In Azure Data Studio, click on the *File* >> *Open File...* and navigate to `SQL-Part-3-Studio.ipynb` you downloaded from canvas.
