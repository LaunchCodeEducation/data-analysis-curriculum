## Getting Started

In Visual Studio Code, open the `SQL-Part-5-Studio.ipynb` file you extracted from the zip file within canvas. You will need some starter data as well, which will be located in the data folder extracted from the zip file.

When you extract the contents of the `sql-part-5-studio.zip` file it will create a directory called "studio". All of the files you need will be located inside.

The files within the data directory are meant to help you populate your tables with some initial values for you to practice with. There are prompts within the studio file to help walk you through this process.
