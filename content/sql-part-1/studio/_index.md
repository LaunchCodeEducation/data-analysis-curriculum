## Getting Started

In Azure Data Studio, click on the *Open* button and navigate to `SQL-Part-1-Studio.ipynb` you downloaded from canvas.  

## In Your Notebook

The focus of this studio is to get more familiar with `SELECT` statements and practice filtering data.
 
1. Break into small groups and work together to answer the questions.  Each member of the group should be coding along in their own notebooks.  
1. The last studio part is for each person to create two questions and queries to answer their questions in their own notebook.  
1. Each member of the group should have different questions and queries for the final part of the studio.
 
## Present to the Class

When the whole class comes back together, each person will present one of the questions they asked and the query used to solve it.
