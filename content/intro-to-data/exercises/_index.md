## Getting Started

For the exercises, answer the following questions about the lifecycle of a MOMA data analysis project. 
As you work through the exercises, refer to the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/momanyc/museum-collection)
page to get the information you need.

Looking at a dataset on Kaggle:

- `A.` Files
- `B.` Column headings
- `C.` File currently open
- `D.` Selected number of columns from total number of columns displayed.
- `E.` Data type: A = strings # = Number


## Create A Document

Using google docs, create a new spreadsheet titled: ``your_name-IntroToDataExercises``.  
Copy the below questions and paste into your document and answer the questions.

**Business Issue**

1. MOMA wants their collection to more accurately represent the art of the world. Currently, critics think it is too Eurocentric. 
    MOMA hears this and wants to look at their collection, particularly artists represented, to determine a path forward to changing the feel of the collection. 
    As part of this, MOMA has tasked their team with doing some analyses on the artists of the collection and how the art came to the museum. 
    You are looking into the artwork that came directly from the artist as a gift to the museum and its visitors.

**Validation:**
The project found that the top 3 artists to donate their work to the museum are: Louise Bourgeois, William Wegman, and Robert Rauschenberg. 

1. How would you go about validating this? For example, who at the museum can you speak with to confirm that this information is accurate?

1. Is there anything in the Credit column that would make you think that you haven't counted a donation properly?
