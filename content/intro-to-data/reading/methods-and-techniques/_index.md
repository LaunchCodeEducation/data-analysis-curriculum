As you continue to learn about data analysis you will certainly come across different types of methods and technologies. Each scenario where data is analyzed might have a completely different use case than the next. Developing an understanding of what method or technique is appropriate to use is a critical skill for beginners!

## Methods and Techniques

1. **Cleaning data**: After data has been collected it will most often need to be cleaned. Since collected data may often be improperly formatted, duplicated, have errors or typos, missing values, or simply incorrect, correcting these mistakes or "cleaning" the data is a very logical step. One of the most important reasons to clean data is so that you do not reach false or inaccurate conclusions when presenting it.
1. **Data Visualization**: Adding a visual to your data is helpful when presenting. It also allows for a better understanding. Using tools and software like google sheets and Microsoft excel amongst others to create basic charts, plots, or histograms is very common practice.
1. **Formatting data**: Providing a specific format for certain columns, rows, values, data types, and more will help mitigate errors in your data. If you are working with data that has a specific length or is of a specific type you can add that parameter to prevent user error when adding and collecting data.
1. **Cluster analysis**: This type of analysis is a technique used to group data together that have similarities. This allows the ability to organize data based on the features present within those groups. There are multiple strategies used to "cluster" data together:
    - **K-means**: defines a number of clusters that you want to group the data into.
    - **Hierarchical clustering**: involves organizing the clusters into a tree diagram. 
    - **Density-based clustering**: creates clusters by identifying areas of high density within the data, separating them from low density areas.

1. **Factor analysis**: Is the practice of finding hidden patterns or commonalities that drive relationships between data, cpmibining these underlying factors into one data point.
1. Time series analysis
1. Sentiment analysis
1. Cohort analysis
1. Exploratory analysis
1. Regression analysis
1. Monte Carlo simulation
1. Descriptive statistics
1. **Classification**: All data is commonly classified by something. You might classify data by time, where the data came from, how it is used, what type of data it is, whether or not the data is public or private, and more. Classifying data will help with the management and organization of the data, data retrieval, and often times security.
1. **Correlation**: Correlation is a measure of how powerful a relationship is between two data points. As an analyst you might find that when one data point changes another one changes in relation. For example a car that weighs more tends to use more fuel, causing a higher miles per gallon average.
