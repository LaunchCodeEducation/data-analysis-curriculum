## What is a Dataset?

Think about working on a monthly budget. Letâ€™s say you have a singular spreadsheet tracking your monthly automatic payments for May that includes info such as the company name, the amount, and the date. Now just this one spreadsheet alone could be a **dataset**. It would be small and you may not be able to gain many insights from just one month of automatic payments, but it is still a dataset. If you wanted to gain further insight into your monthly payments, your dataset might include every spreadsheet you have of automatic payments for the past year. If you wanted an overview of your whole budget, you might add spreadsheets of your taxes, paychecks, and grocery bills to your dataset, such as the dataset below.

## KPIs

**Key Performance Indicators** are commonly used across many businesses and organizations. Their purpose is to measure performance and provide additional insight towards future decision making processes. However each KPI is only as effective as it's parameters, often times problems can arrise if KPIs revolve around goals or datapoints that dont actually drive business success. A common misuse of KPIs may be related to overall quanitity of something versus the quality of it.

Using the `SMART` method will help when structuring KPIs so that you ensure that they provide useful insights and observations. The `SMART` method when related to goals states that they should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.

One of the many benefits that KPIs bring to a business is that when used properly, assists in creating cross-team collaboration and alignment around a common organizational goal.

Once a team has a good understanding of KPIs and how it relates to their project it will help you identify what kind of data is and is not relevant. Furthermore when you are viewing datasets it will allow the user to more easily and swiftly filter and clean data.
