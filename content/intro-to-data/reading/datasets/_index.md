## What is a Dataset?

Think about working on a monthly budget. Letâ€™s say you have a singular spreadsheet tracking your monthly automatic payments for May that includes info such as the company name, the amount, and the date. Now just this one spreadsheet alone could be a dataset. It would be small and you may not be able to gain many insights from just one month of automatic payments, but it is still a dataset. If you wanted to gain further insight into your monthly payments, your dataset might include every spreadsheet you have of automatic payments for the past year. If you wanted an overview of your whole budget, you might add spreadsheets of your taxes, paychecks, and grocery bills to your dataset, such as the dataset below.
