Data cleaning techniques aim to address issues and fix errors within the dataset before you begin to analyze the actual. This might sound odd because you initially analyze the data before deciding on what techniques you might need to utilize to clean it up. However, cleaning data usually helps get it to a more analysis-friendly or readable state even if it includes some analysis to get there. 

Below we will cover some common techniques that are used to "clean" data sets.

## Common Data Cleaning Techniques

1. Filtering - Using a filter will solve many issues as it pertains to cleaning data. With filters you can hide specific rows, only have columns display data that meets the user-provided criteria like dates, test scores, or locations.
1. Sorting - Sorting your data might involve moving rows or columns around to be more in-line with their numeric characters or names. This might help you identify a duplicate column or row within your dataset.
1. Removing Trailing Whitespace
1. Standardizing number or data formats
1. Use functions to help standardize data accross the entire set
1. Remove Redundant data
