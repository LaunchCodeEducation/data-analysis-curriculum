## Intro to Data Cleaning

Cleaning data is one of the first and most important steps when working with any kind of dataset. This process helps ensure that you are starting with an accurate set of data by removing redundancies, outliers, missing data, and any innaccuracies. If the proper steps are not taken to clean your dataset you may lower the quality and integrity of the data since it may still contain errors that were not removed before in-depth analysis.

The process of cleaning data should help you get comfortable with:
- Identifying missing, irregular, unnecessary, and inaccurate data
- Fixing formatting and type errors
- Adding filters
- Applying functions
- Handling outliers
