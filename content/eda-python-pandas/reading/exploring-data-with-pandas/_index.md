Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA as you already know is a critical step when beginning your analysis work. Similar to the EDA work with spreadsheets we will do the same with Python and **pandas** in order to accomplish the following:

1. Form a hypotheses about what is the underlying forces effecting your data.
1. Challenge previous assumptions that may have been made when discussing the business issue.
1. Guide you on what tools and techniques you should use when working with that dataset.

**pandas** and other libraries that we will use like **NumPy** is that they are not default Python packages. This means that we will need to install and import them into our workspace to use their functionality.

The **pandas** library is incredibly powerful and was built specifically for data analysis work. The library comes with many useful tools and data structures that we will cover more in depth in the upcoming readings.
