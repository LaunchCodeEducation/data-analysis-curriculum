## [Date and Time Data Types and Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/date-and-time-data-types-and-functions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15)

| **Function** | **Definition** | **Syntax** | **Value Returned** |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|---------------------|
| [GETDATE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/getdate-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) | Returns a timestamp that includes the date and time of the server. | `SELECT GETDATE()` | 2022-01-04 22:12:25.567 |
| [SYSDATETIME](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/sysdatetime-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) | Returns a timestamp that includes the date and time of the server. `SYSDATETIME` is more precise with the seconds than `GETTIME`. | `SELECT SYSDATETIME()` | 2022-01-04 22:12:25.5675908 |
| [DATEADD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/dateadd-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) | Adds a time period to a date. In this example, we are increasing the month value from `02` (February) to `03` (March). | `SELECT DATEADD(month, 1, '20220224');` | 2022-03-24 00:00:00.000 |
| [DATEDIFF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/datediff-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) | Calculates and returns the difference of a date part between an end date and a start date. | `SELECT DATEDIFF(day, '2022-11-13', '2022-12-12');` | 29 |
| DATEDIFF | Can also be used to compare months. | `SELECT DATEDIFF(month, '2022-11-13', '2022-12-12');` | 1 |
| DATEDIFF | Can also compare years. | `SELECT DATEDIFF(year, '1984-11-13', '2022-12-12');` | 38 |
| [DATENAME](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/datename-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) | Returns a string representing the desired date part. This example selects the day. | `SELECT DATENAME(day, '2022-07-25');` | 25 |
| DATENAME | month | `SELECT DATENAME(month, '2022-07-25');` | July |
| DATENAME | year | `SELECT DATENAME(year, '2022-07-25');` | 2022 |
| [DATEPART](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/datepart-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) | Returns an integer representing the desired date part. This example selects the day. | `SELECT DATEPART(day, '2022-08-21');` | 21 |
| DATEPART | month | `SELECT DATEPART(month, '2022-08-21');` | 08 |
| DATEPART | year | `SELECT DATEPART(year, '2022-08-21');` | 2022 |
| [DAY](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/day-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16) | Select the day | `SELECT DAY('2022-08-21');` | 21 |
| [MONTH](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/month-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16) | Select the month | `SELECT MONTH('2022-08-21');` | 8 |
| [YEAR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/year-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16) | Select the year | `SELECT YEAR('2022-08-21');` | 2022 |
| [CONVERT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/cast-and-convert-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15#j-using-convert-with-datetime-data-in-different-formats) | Paired with `GETDATE` to [convert other data types into dates and times](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/date-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15#converting-date-to-other-date-and-time-types) based on the desired format. | `SELECT CONVERT(varchar, GETDATE());` | Jan  5 2022  7:25PM |
| CONVERT | These examples convert the server date into various formats. The first example is the default format, the second example is format number 7. | `SELECT CONVERT(varchar, GETDATE(), 7);` | Jan 05, 22 |
| [FORMAT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/format-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) | Used to set the format or reformat dates. This example is using the following date information: `Jan  5, 2022  7:38PM`. The first example the server date is formatted date, month, year. The time is not requested, so it is not returned. | `SELECT FORMAT(GETDATE(), 'dd/MM/yyyy');` | 05/01/2022 |
| FORMAT | The second example requests only the time in hours and minutes. Note that `MM` is used for months and `mm` is used for minutes. | `SELECT FORMAT(GETDATE(), 'hh:mm');` | 07:38 |

Willow wants to have all the dates in her database in the same format of `month-day-year`.  She used the following syntax: `FORMAT(ModifiedDate, 'mm/dd/yyyy')` and received an error message.  Why?
