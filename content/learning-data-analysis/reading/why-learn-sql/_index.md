Structured query language or SQL is the coding language we will be using to interact with databases. While spreadsheets can hold a lot of data, a database can hold even more. Databases can also establish relationships between data. SQL refers to a family of languages that all do this same task. T-SQL or Transactional SQL is the one we will be focusing on for this course.

At the level that we are working, you may not notice any differences between T-SQL and other forms of SQL. The differences get larger the deeper you get into your SQL learning journey so it is important that you make sure that you are focusing on T-SQL when looking up alternate resources.
