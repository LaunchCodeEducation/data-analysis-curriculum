Spreadsheets are a great way for us to begin to explore data. Many data analysts use spreadsheets in their day-to-day work in conjunction with other tools. Spreadsheets store data in a grid of columns and rows. Spreadsheet software, such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel, allow the user to click through this data, run calculations, and create visuals to illustrate what is happening in the data. If you have worked with spreadsheets before, you might have seen multiple spreadsheets or tabs within one project. Those projects are oftentimes called workbooks.

For this course, we will be using Google Sheets. Google Sheets is free to use to anyone with a personal or business Google account. We can filter data, make graphs, and compose formulas to complete our analysis of what is happening in the data. As you progress further in your career, you may want to explore Microsoft Excel too. As we stated in the introduction, we are here to give you the foundations you need to launch your learning. Google Sheets will help you understand the foundations of spreadsheets and key functions that you need to use. If you are not already a Microsoft user, you may find Microsoft Excel to be cost-prohibitive so by using Google Sheets, you can take the time to decide if you would like to save up for a license.
