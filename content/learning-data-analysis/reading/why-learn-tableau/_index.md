The final tool we will be covering in this course is Tableau. Tableau is a powerful tool for putting together data visualizations. One key part of being a data analyst is sharing your findings with other analysts and business leaders.
Visualizations can help portray to these other users what is going on with the data.

While we work on Tableau, we will be focusing not just on setting up these visualizations, but also learning more about what makes a good visualization. What style of visualization helps tell the story and other tips and tricks to strengthen your presentations so if you end up using another tool, like PowerBI, on the job, the concepts you learned while working on visualizations in Tableau will transfer over.
