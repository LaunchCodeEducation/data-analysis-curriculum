Many people suggest learning Python first out of the many programming languages available. Python can be extremely forgiving and is not strongly-typed, meaning that you do not have to specify the type of a variable when declaring and initializing it. Python also comes with a number of modules and libraries we as data analysts can use to perform complex mathematical operations and visualize data.
