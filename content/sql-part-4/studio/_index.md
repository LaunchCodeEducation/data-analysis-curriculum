## Getting Started

In Visual Studio Code, open the `SQL-Part-4-Studio.ipynb` file that is located within the `data-analysis-projects` repository you forked and cloned in an earlier lesson.

## In Your Notebook
For this studio, you will be working in small groups and using `BooksDB`. One group member should screen share while fellow group members code along in their own notebooks.  Each group member will submit a link to their studio notebook.

You are back at the bookstore helping employees with their inventory of books. Four employees need your help with finding books to create in-store displays.  Read their requests and decide if you want to use a correlated subquery, nested subquery, `UNION` operator, `EXCEPT` operator, or `INTERSECT` operator. You may not use any joins or add multiple statements to the `WHERE` clause unless explicitly asked.

## Submitting Your Work

When finished, upload your completed document to canvas!
