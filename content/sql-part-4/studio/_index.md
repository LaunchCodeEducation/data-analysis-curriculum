## Getting Started

For this weeks studio, open the `SQL-Part-4-Studio.ipynb` notebook in `data-analysis-projects/sql-part-4/studio` using Azure Data Studio

## In Your Notebook
For this studio, you will be working in small groups and using `BooksDB`.  One group member should screen share while fellow group members code along in their own notebooks.  Each group member will submit a link to their studio notebook.

You are back at the bookstore helping employees with their inventory of books.   Four employees need your help with finding books to create in-store displays.  Read their requests and decide if you want to use a correlated subquery, nested subquery, UNION operator, EXCEPT operator, or INTERSECT operator.  You may not use any joins or add multiple statements to the WHERE clause unless explicitly asked.

## Submitting Your Work

When finished make sure to push your changes up to GitHub.

Copy the link to your GitHub repository and paste it into the submission box in Canvas for **Studio: SQL Part 4** and click *Submit*.
