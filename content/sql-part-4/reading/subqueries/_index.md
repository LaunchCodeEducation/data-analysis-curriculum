**Subqueries** are similar to nested conditionals in that it is a `SQL` statement nested inside of another. Subqueries are commonly nested inside of a `SELECT` statement but are also used within the `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements.

One of the many benefits of using subqueries is that it allows you to apply aggregate functions within a `WHERE` clause.
