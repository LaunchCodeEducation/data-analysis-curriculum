## Getting Started

Please use your best judgment on the chart style, layout, and interpretation of the list below. This is an exercise to get hands-on experience with Tableau. This will be the first stop on a journey of many skills!

1. We will be using the [Mushroom Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification) dataset from Kaggle.  Download the CSV file.
1. Open Tableau Public and connect to your dataset.  
1. Create visualizations for the following:  (a sheet for each).
    - How many Mushrooms are poisonous vs edible?
    - How many different habitats were mushrooms collected from?
    - How many Mushroom habitats compared to class?
    - How many Mushrooms sorted by class and cap-color?
    - [Create aliases](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/datafields_fieldproperties_aliases_ex1editing.htm) for each letter in the chart from the above bullet point.
      - Use the context provided in the dataset for what each letter represents.
      - Explore the “Marks” card to add color or size to chart d based on the chart design you have chosen.
      - Give your chart a new title.
   - Create your own chart with at least 2 dimensions and aliases to provide context.
   - Create a dashboard with at least 2 of your sheets.
   - Save and publish your dashboard.
