In the next few lessons of class, we will be using Tableau Public to create visualizations (vizzes) for our data. In our time spent together learning Tableau, we are going to cover the basics. There are so many features and functionalities that we don't have time to explore; however, a fun feature of Tableau Public is the Viz of the Day.

The Viz of the Day is a collection of vizzes created by others that are incredible in design and functionality. These vizzes can not only provide you with inspiration, but you can also learn from them. If you see a viz that you like, download it and explore the viz in Tableau. You should play with the aspects of the viz and then try to recreate it for yourself. This will help you get more comfortable with Tableau.

We are all inspired by different things, but we can learn so much from these differences. We would like you to look through Tableau Public's Viz of the Day and share a link to a viz that you found interesting, inspiring, or downright clever. Tableau Public has a wonderful collection of vizzes to discover beyond the Viz of the Day. Explore any of the links below for a viz that you enjoy, and share your favorites in slack.
