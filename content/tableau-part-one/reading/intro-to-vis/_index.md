We will be using the desktop application for Tableau public for the duration of this course. Make sure to download the Tableau Desktop Public free edition.

Start out by creating a [Tableau Public Account](https://public.tableau.com/app/discover) and logging in.

After downloading the desktop application, you should see an option to Create a new workspace, which will lead you to a view similar to the below image:

For the time being, click the `X` on the connect to data option, we will not be doing that just yet!

Now that you have opened up a new workbook within Tableau Public it is time to begin exploring and getting comfortable with the many features that are available.

Throughout the following readings we will cover the following:

1. Navigating a Tableau public workspace
1. Connecting to a data source
1. Understandng how Tableau interprets data
1. Building your very first chart!
