## Getting Started

Download the [World Happiness Report - 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainaru/world-happiness-report-2024-yearly-updated) dataset from Kaggle. The goal of these exercises will be to create a dashboard that visualizes happiness throughout the world!

Create a new data source and upload the `World-happiness-report-updated_2024.csv` file.

### Sheet 1: Happiness Score

The first worksheet will contain a geographical map of the world to help visualize the happiness score for each country.

1. Drag and drop the `longitude` pill into the `Columns` shelf, and the `latitude` pill into the `Rows` shelf.
1. Add the `Country Name` pill as a `Label` within the `Marks` card.
1. Lastly, add the `Life Ladder` as a `Color` within the `Marks` card.

This provides a visual of the happiness score for each country using color as an indicator.

Feel free to play around with the settings like `Color`.

### Sheet 2: Positive and Negative affect

The `Positive affect` and `Negative affect` are columns related to responses to questions about positive and negative emotions experienced yesterday. Let's visualize these!
